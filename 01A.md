## Personal Pitch

Tell me about your background.

## Questions

What is the event Loop?

How do you keep up to date with new Technologies?

## Behavioral

Have you handled a difficult situation with a co-worker? How?

## White Board

### String Compression

For each character in a string log the character and the count in a compressed format. Exp stringCompression("aaabbcca") // => "a3b2c2a1"

```js
const stringCompression = str => {
  let output = "";
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    count++;
    if (str[i] != str[i + 1]) {
      output += str[i] + count;
      count = 0;
    }
  }
  return output;
};
```


### Duplicates

Write a function that takes an array and returns its duplicate values.

Examples:

duplicates([2,2,2,1,4]) // => [2]
duplicates([]) // => []
duplicates(["what", "are", 7, "doing"]) //=> []

Hints:

What type of collection has constant lookup/set methods?
Follow-up Questions:

What if we want to preserve the order of our dupes?
Can we do this with constant space? How does it impact our time complexity?

```js
const duplicates = arr => {
	let dups = new Set();
	let output = new Set();
	arr.forEach(el => {
		if(dups.has(el)) {
			output.add(el)
		} else {
			dups.add(el)
		}
	})
	return [...output]
}


```
