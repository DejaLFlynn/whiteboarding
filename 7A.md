## Personal Pitch

What makes you, you?

## Questions

What is a potential pitfall with using typeof bar === "object" to determine if bar is an object? How can this pitfall be avoided?

What is the significance, and what are the benefits, of including 'use strict' at the beginning of a JavaScript source file?

## Behavioral

Tell me about a time you were able to successfully deal with another person even when that individual may not have personally liked you (or vice versa).

Tell me about a difficult decision you've made in the last year.

## White Board

### Count And Say
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.


Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: "1"
Example 2:

Input: 4
Output: "1211"

```js

var countAndSay = function(n, rep = 1, str = "1") {
    if(rep === n) return str;
    let result = "";
    let counter = 1;
    let currChar = str[0]

    for(let i = 1; i < str.length; i++) {
        if(str[i] === currChar) {
            counter++
        } else {
            result += counter + currChar;
            counter = 1;
            currChar = str[i]
        }
    }
    result += counter + currChar;

    return countAndSay(n, ++rep, result)

};

```
### Array Rotate

Create a function that rotates an array. It should take in an array and a number of rotations. Positives numbers should rotate to the left, and negative numbers should rotate to the right. Your function should  default to one left rotation.

Input: rotate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
Output: [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 1 ]

Input: rotate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4)
Output: [ 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

Input: rotate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], -1)
Output: [ 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

```js
const rotate = (arr, times = 1) => {
	let dup = arr.slice(0);
	return dup.splice(times % arr.length).concat(dup)
}

```
