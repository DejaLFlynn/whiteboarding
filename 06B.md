## Personal Pitch

What led you here today?

## Questions

Tell me about the hardest bug you've ever resolved.

What happens when you enter something on Google?

## Behavioral

Tell me about a time when you had too many things to do and you were required to prioritize your tasks.

Give me an example of a time when you had to make a split second decision.

## White Board

### Merge Sorted Linked Lists

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:

Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4

```js
var mergeTwoLists = function(l1, l2) {
    let head = new ListNode(null)
    let top = head;
    while(l1 && l2) {
        if(l1.val < l2.val) {
            head.next = l1
            l1 = l1.next
        } else {
            head.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        }               
        head = head.next
    }
    if(l1) { head.next = l1 }
    if(l2) { head.next = l2 }

    return top.next
};


```

### Stair Stepper

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

After solving this problem in a naive solution, push the person to make their solution more performant. Hint: Memoization.


```js

var climbStairs = function(n, memo ={0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}) {
    if(memo[n]) return memo[n]
    return  memo[n] = climbStairs(n - 1, memo) + climbStairs(n - 2, memo)
};


```
