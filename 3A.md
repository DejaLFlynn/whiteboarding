## Personal Pitch

What makes you, you?

## Questions

What is hoisting in JavaScript? Give an example of how it might be used.

Explain Event Bubbling.

## Behavioral

Tell me about a time when you had to go above and beyond the call of duty in order to get a job done, or when you took the initiative to do something that you werenâ€™t asked to do.

Give me an example of a time when priorities were shifted on you. How did you react?

## White Board

### Cyclic
Consider a linked list. Each link in the list holds a next reference to the next item in the list, except for the final link, which points to nil.

It is possible to have a "list" without any end, which loops back on itself. Possibilities:

A -> B -> C -> A -> ...
A -> B -> C -> B -> ...
Write a method cyclic?(first_link), which will return true if a list is cyclic. Your first version may use O(n) memory. Next, write a version which uses O(1) memory; you'll probably need a different approach.  

```JS
var hasCycle = function(head) {
    let runner = head
    let walker = head
    while(runner && runner.next) {
        runner = runner.next.next
        walker = walker.next
        if(runner === walker) {
           return true
        }    
    }
    return false
};

```                

Given two singly-linked lists of (possibly) differing lengths that converge at some point, find the node at which they converge.

Imagine two runners, running at the same speed across the linked lists. If one list is longer than the other, the shorter list's runner will reach the end first. The difference between the two runners' times is the difference in length between the two lists. Knowing this, we can give one runner a head-start of a distance equivalent to the difference in length between the two lists. Then traversing both lists at equal speed will result in the two runners colliding at the intersection point.


### Flatten
Write a function that flattens a multi dimensional array

```js
const flatten = (arr) => {
	return arr.reduce((acc, currEl) => {
		return acc.concat(Array.isArray(currEl) ? flatten(currEl) : currEl)
	}, [])
}

```
