## Personal Pitch

What makes you, you?

## Questions

What is hoisting in JavaScript? Give an example of how it might be used.

Explain Event Bubbling.

## Behavioral

Tell me about a time when you had to go above and beyond the call of duty in order to get a job done, or when you took the initiative to do something that you werenâ€™t asked to do.

Give me an example of a time when priorities were shifted on you. How did you react?

## White Board

### Spiral Order

Given a square matrix in the form of a 2D array-of-arrays, return an array consisting of the values of the array in "spiral order" (top row, then right hand side, then bottom in reverse, then up, the back again...).

```js
const spiralOrder = (mtx) => {
    let output = []
    while(mtx.length) {
        output = [...output,...top(mtx), ...right(mtx), ...bottom(mtx), ...left(mtx) ]
    }

    return output
};

const top = (mtx) => {
    if(!mtx.length) return [];
    return mtx.shift();
}

const right = mtx => {
    let output = []
    for(let i = 0; i < mtx.length; i++) {
        let num = mtx[i].pop()
        if(num) output.push(num)
    }
    return output
}

const bottom = mtx => {
    if(!mtx.length) return [];
    return mtx.pop().reverse();
}

const left = mtx => {
    let output = []
    for(let i = mtx.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        let num = mtx[i].shift()
        if(num) output.push(num)
    }
    return output
}

```

### Sum Rec
Write a function that takes an array of integers and recursively computes the sum.

Clarify if needed:

Time complexity should be O(n)

Hints

What is the base case?
What is the result of sum_rec([])?
What is the time complexity of #slice, #drop, etc?
(It's O(n), so if we #drop on each recursive call, time complexity bumps to O(n ^ 2))
How can we avoid creating a new array each time?


```js

const sumRec = (arr, head = 0, tail = arr.length, sum = 0) => {
  if (head === tail) return sum;
  return sumRec(arr, head + 1, tail, sum + arr[head]);
}

```
