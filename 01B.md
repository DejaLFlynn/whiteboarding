## White Board

### Transformable

Given two strings, return whether the second can be transformed into the first by removing characters.

Ex. aabbaa can be transformed into aba by removing a, b, and a

Clarifications:

We can assume str2 always has greater or equal length than str1

Hints:

What if str1 is an empty string?
Start with the case where str1 === str2 and then build up


```js
const transformable = (str1, str2) => {
	if(!str1.length) return false;
	let obj = {};
	for(let i = 0; i < str2.length; i++) {
		obj[str2[i]] ? obj[str2[i]]++ : obj[str2[i]] = 1
	}

	for(let j = 0; j < str1.length; j++ ) {
		if(obj[str1[j]]) {
			obj[str1[j]]--
		} else {
			return false;
		}
	}
	return true
}

```


### Goofy Years

Write a function that takes a year and returns an array with the 10 closest subsequent years that meet the following condition: the first two digits summed with the last two digits are equal to the middle two digits.

Clarify if asked:

Year is a four digit integer
Examples:
1978 => 19 + 78 = 97
2307 => 23 + 07 = 30

```
function goofyYears(yr) {
  const years = [];
  let currentYear = yr;
  while (years.length !== 10) {
    currentYear++;
    if (isGoofyYear(currentYear)) years.push(currentYear)
  }

  return years;
}

function isGoofyYear(yr) {
	 const year = yr.toString();
    const firstTwo = parseInt(year.slice(0, 2));
    const middleTwo = parseInt(year.slice(1, 3));
    const lastTwo = parseInt(year.slice(2));
		return (firstTwo + lastTwo) === middleTwo
}
```
