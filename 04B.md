## Personal Pitch

How did you get into coding?

## Questions

Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions.

What is the difference between a left join and a join.

## Behavioral

Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with this situation?

Give me an example of a time you managed numerous responsibilities. How did you handle that?

## White Board

### Missing Number

You are given two arrays as inputs. 
Assume one array is of non-negative integers. The second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array. Do this in linear time with constant memory use.

```js

const adder = (arr) => arr.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0)

const missingNumber = (arr1, arr2) =>  adder(arr1) - adder(arr2)
```

### myReduce

Implement your own version of reduce. Do this both iteratively and recursively.

```js
Array.prototype.myReduce = function(callback, initialValue) {
    let counter = 0;
    let accumulator;
    if (initialValue === undefined) {
        accumulator = this[0];
        counter = 1;
    } else {
        accumulator = initialValue;
    }
    for (let i = counter; i < this.length; i++) {
        accumulator = callback(accumulator, this[i])
    }

    return accumulator;
}




Array.prototype.myReduce = function(fn, acc) {
	let [head, ...tail] = this;
	if(head === undefined) return acc;
	if(!acc) {
		let [second, ...rest] = tail
		return rest.myReduce(fn, fn(head, second))
	}
	return tail.myReduce(fn, fn(acc, head))

}

```
