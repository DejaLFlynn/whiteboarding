## Personal Pitch

What was the journey that led you to this point?

## Questions

What is functional programming?

What are three types of function invocation?

## Behavioral

Tell me about a time when you delegated a project effectively.

Tell me about a time when you missed an obvious solution to a problem.

## White Board

### Caesar Cipher

There once was time when you could write a nearly
uncrackable code by simply taking each letter of a message and incrementing it
by a fixed number, so "abc" by 2 would look like "cde", wrapping around back
to "a" when you pass "z".  

Write a function, caesarCipher(str, shift) which
will take a message and an increment amount. The output should be the encoded message.

If asked:
   Assume lowercase and no punctuation. Preserve spaces.

```js

const caesarCipher = (str, shift) => {
  const alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.split('')
  let encoded = ""

  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (str[i] === ' ') {
      encoded += ' ';
      continue
    }

    const offset = (alphabet.indexOf(str[i]) + shift) % 26
    encoded += alphabet[offset]
  }

  return encoded
}


```

### Binary

Write a function that converts a decimal integer to binary. However, the usage of Number.toString(2) or Math.pow() or even bitwise operators are forbidden.


```js

function decToBin(input) {
  let remaining = input;
  const output = [];
  while (remaining) {
    output.push(remaining % 2);
    remaining = Math.floor(remaining / 2);
  }
  return output.reverse().join('');
}

```
