## Personal Pitch

Tell me about your background.

## Questions

What are the falsey values in JavaScript?

What advantage is there for using the arrow syntax for a method in a constructor?

## Behavioral

Give me an example of a time when you used your fact-finding skills or resourcefulness to solve a problem.

Tell me about a time when you faced a problem you couldnâ€™t solve. What did you do?

## White Board

### Digital Root

Write a method, digitalRoot(num). It should Sum the digits of a positive // integer. If it is greater than 10, sum the digits of the resulting number. // Keep repeating until there is only one digit in the result, called the // "digital root". Do not use string conversion within your method. Feel free to write it iteratively first

```js
const digitalRoot = (num) => {
	if(num < 10) return num;
	let lastNumber = num % 10;
	let newNumber = Math.floor(num / 10);
	return digitalRoot(lastNumber + newNumber)
}

```

### Find Middle

Write a function, findMiddle, that accepts a Linked List's head node as an argument, passes through the list once, and returns the value in the middle node. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

```js
var middleNode = function(head) {
    let [runner, walker] = [head, head];
    while(runner.next && runner.next.next) {
        runner = runner.next.next;
        walker = walker.next
    }
    return runner.next ? walker.next : walker;
};

```
