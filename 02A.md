### Pair Sum

Given an array of integers, return all unique element pairs that sum up to a specified value k. List the pairs in [min, max] order.

Clarify if asked:

Aim for better than O(n^2), you can do it!
Tips:

What would the O(n^2) approach look like?
Is there a data structure you can use to improve the time complexity?


```js
const pairSum = (arr, target) => {
  const seen = {}
  const pairs = []

  arr.forEach(el => {
    const searching = target - el

    if (el in seen) {
      const pair = [Math.min(el, searching), Math.max(el, searching)]
      pairs.push(pair)
    } else {
      seen[searching] = el
    }
  })

  return pairs
}

// Input: pairSum([5, 6, 2, 1, 0, 4, 5], 10)
// Output: [ [ 4, 6 ], [ 5, 5 ] ]
```


### Matrix Area Sum

Given a matrix of integers and the top left and bottom right coordinates of a rectangular area within the matrix, find the sum of numbers falling inside the rectangle.

Example:
```
# matrix
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 0 1 2

sumMatrix(matrix, [1, 1], [2, 3]) //=> 24

Row/column indices are inclusive (`sumMatrix(matrix, [1, 2], [2, 3])` will
  include the element at (2, 3)


const sumMatrix = (mtx, leftTop, rightBottom) => {
	let sum = 0;
	for(let i = leftTop[0]; i <= rightBottom[1]; i++) {
		for(let j = leftTop[1]; j <= rightBottom[0]; j++) {
			sum += mtx[j][i]
		}
	}
	return sum
}

```
