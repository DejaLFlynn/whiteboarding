## White Board

### String Compression

For each character in a string log the character and the count in a compressed format. Exp stringCompression("aaabbcca") // => "a3b2c2a1"

For each consecutive character in a string, log the number of times that character appears in a row. So, for example, "aaa" becomes "a3" because "a" appears three times in that string.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string as an argument and converts that string to this compressed format.

```js
const stringCompression = str => {
  let output = "";
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    count++;
    if (str[i] != str[i + 1]) {
      output += str[i] + count;
      count = 0;
    }
  }
  return output;
};
```


### Duplicates

Write a function that takes an array and returns its duplicate values.

Examples:

duplicates([1,2,1,4]) // => [1]
duplicates([]) // => []
duplicates(["hey", "you", 4, "gonna be a big A", :potato]) //=> []

Hints:

What type of collection has constant lookup/set methods?
Follow-up Questions:

What if we want to preserve the order of our dupes?
Can we do this with constant space? How does it impact our time complexity?

```js
const duplicates = arr => {
	let dups = new Set();
	let output = [];
	arr.forEach(el => {
		if(dups.has(el)) {
			output.push(el)
		} else {
			dups.add(el)
		}
	})
	return output
}

```
