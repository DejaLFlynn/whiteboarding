## White Board

### Shuffle
Write a function that randomly shuffles an array.

```js

function shuffle (arr) {
	arr.forEach((el, i) => {
		let rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length);
		[arr[i], arr[rand]] = [arr[rand], arr[i]]
	})
	return arr
}

```

### myMap
Implement the map function in JavaScript using recursion.


```js

const myMap = (arr, cb, idx = 0, result = []) => {
	if(idx === arr.length) return result;
	result.push(cb(arr[idx]))
	return myMap(arr, cb, ++idx, result)
}

```
