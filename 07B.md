## Personal Pitch

Give some information about yourself.

## Questions

What is NaN? What is its type? How can you reliably test if a value is equal to NaN?

Can you name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers?

## Behavioral

Tell me about a recent situation in which you had to deal with a very upset customer or coworker.

Give me an example of a time when you motivated others.

## White Board

### Move Zeroes

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

```
Example:

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

```

Note:

You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.


```js
const moveZeroes = nums => {
  let idx = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== 0) {
      nums[idx] = nums[i];
      nums[i] = idx === i ? nums[i] : 0;
      idx++;
    }
  }
}

```

### Remove Dups

Write a function that takes in an array and returns a new array with all unique elements.

Exp: [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2] //=> [1, 2, 3]

Exp2: ["hello", "world", "hello"] //=> ["hello", "world"]

```js

const removeDups = arr => [...new Set(arr)]

```
