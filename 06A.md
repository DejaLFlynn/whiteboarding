## Personal Pitch

Tell me about your background.

## Questions

In JavaScript, what is a closure? How are closures used and why are they important?

What's a tool/language you're interested in learning and why?

## Behavioral

Tell me about a time when you had to use your presentation skills to influence someone's opinion.

Give me a specific example of a time when you had to conform to a policy with which you did not agree.

## White Board

### Reverse A Linked List
Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:

Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
Follow up:

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

```js

var reverseList = function(head) {
    let node = head;
    let previous = null;
    while(node) {
        let temp = node.next;
        node.next = previous
        previous = node
        node = temp  

    }
    return previous
};

```

### Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Your solution should run in O(n) time.

Example:
```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

```

```js

var maxSubArray = function(nums) {
    let max = nums[0];
    let curr = nums[0];
    for(let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if(curr < 0 && nums[i] > curr) {
            curr = nums[i]
        } else {
          curr += nums[i];
        }

        if(curr > max) max = curr;


    }
    return max
};

```
