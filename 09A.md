## Personal Pitch

Tell me about your background.

## Questions

Can you describe the main difference between a .forEach loop and a .map() loop and why you would pick one versus the other?

What are the variable naming conventions in JavaScript?  

## Behavioral

Describe a time when you set your sights too high (or too low).

How do you typically handle conflict?

## White Board

### The Deepest of the Dups

Write a function that performs a deep duplication of an arrays interior arrays.

Remember:

```
let arr = [[1, [2, 3]], [4]]
let dup = arr.slice(0)
dup[0][1][0] = "corey"
console.log(dup) //=> [ [ 1, [ 'corey', 3 ] ], [ 4 ] ]
console.log(arr) //=> [ [ 1, [ 'corey', 3 ] ], [ 4 ] ]

This is undesired behavior.


```js

const deepDup = arr => {
	return arr.map(el => Array.isArray(el) ? deepDup(el) : el)
}

```

### Where are the duplicates?

Write a function that will return an object containing the indices of all
duplicate elements. The keys are the duplicate elements; the values are
arrays of their indices in ascending order, e.g.
dups([1, 3, 4, 3, 0, 3, 0]) //=> { 3 => [1, 3, 5], 0 => [4, 6] }

```js

const dups = arr => {
	let result = arr.reduce((acc, currEl, idx) => {
		acc[currEl] === undefined ? acc[currEl] = [idx] : acc[currEl].push(idx)
		return acc
	}, {})
	for(key in result) {
		if(result[key].length === 1){
			delete result[key]
		}
	}
	return result
}


```
