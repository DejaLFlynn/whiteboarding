How did you get into coding?

## Questions

What are the data types supported by JavaScript?

What are some pros and cons about JS? What about Express?

Describe a time when you anticipated potential problems and developed preventive measures.

Tell me about a time when you were forced to make an unpopular decision.

## White Board

### Jumble Sort

Write a function that takes in a string and an alphabet. It should return a copy of the string with the letters re-ordered according to their positions in the alphabet. If no alphabet is passed in, it defaults to normal alphabetical order (a-z).

Example:
jumble_sort("hello") => "ehllo"
jumble_sort("hello", ['o', 'l', 'h', 'e']) => 'ollhe'

```js

const jumbleSort = (str, alphabet = null) => {
  alphabet = alphabet || 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.split('');
  str = str.split('');

  let sorted = false;
  while (!sorted) {
    sorted = true
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
      if (i === str.length - 1) break
      let current = str[i]
      let next = str[i + 1];
      if (alphabet.indexOf(current) > alphabet.indexOf(next)) {
        str[i] = next;
        str[i + 1] = current;
        sorted = false;
      }
    }
  }

  return str.join('');
}


```

### String Includes

Write a function that takes in a string to search and a key string.
Return true if the string contains all of the characters in the key
in the same order that they appear in the key.

Bonus: Write it recursively

stringIncludeKey("cadbpc", "abc") //=> true

stringIncludeKey("cba", "abc") //=> false


```js
const stringIncludeKey = (string, key) => {
  if (!key.length) return true;

  let nextKeyChar = key[0];
  let keyIndex = string.indexOf(nextKeyChar);

  if (keyIndex < 0) return false;
  return stringIncludeKey(string.slice(keyIndex + 1), key.slice(1))
}


```
